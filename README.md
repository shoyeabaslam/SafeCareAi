# SafeCareAi
SafeCareAi is a web application built with React using Vite, aimed at providing users with information about the safety of various products based on their ingredients. Users can upload images or input ingredient lists to check the safety rating of products. The application utilizes GSAP for animations, React Icons for UI icons, React Toasts for notifications, HTML2Canvas and jsPDF for creating PDF reports, React Circular Progressbar for displaying overall safety percentage, Tesseract for extracting text from images, and React Image Crop for cropping images.
